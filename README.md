This project demonstrates a password visibility toggle input field implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user can switch between showing and hiding their password by clicking an icon.

# Features
**•	Password Input Field:** Allows users to input their password securely.
**•	Dynamic Toggle:** Users can toggle password visibility using an eye icon.
**•	Interactive Design:** Floating labels and a responsive design create a clean and engaging user interface.
**•	Custom Styling:** Styled with CSS for a visually appealing layout.


**# Technologies Used
**•	HTML:** Structure and content.
**•	CSS:** Styling and design.
**•	JavaScript:** Functional behaviour (toggle functionality).


# How It Works
1.	The password input field is initially set to type password to mask the characters.
2.	A toggle button (icon) is positioned on the right side of the input field.
3.	Clicking the toggle button:
o	Changes the input field type to text, making the password visible.
o	Updates the icon to indicate the visibility status.
4.	Clicking again reverts the input field type to password and resets the icon.
